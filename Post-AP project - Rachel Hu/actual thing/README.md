PROJECT TITLE: Organic, homemade MS paint
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: PostAP Project for APCSA
VERSION or DATE: v1.06.03 (June 8, 2021)
AUTHORS: Rachel Hu

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the Main class

USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
    Turn on word wrapping in the program you are viewing this in unless you want to cry while reading this.

    Run the Main class, and a window named "Organic, homemade MS paint" should appear. The white space in here is your canvas. Use the mouse to click and drag to draw lines. 
    
    The row of colorful buttons at the top are default colors. You can pick a custom color with RGB by clicking on the button labeled "Custom Color"; a window will appear. Three sets of sliders and textboxes will appear, each labeled with their respective RGB value. Pick your color by moving the sliders (they have a range of 0-225 from left to right) or by typing in the RGB value into the box. The rectangle under "Preview" on the left will update to the color represented by the RGB values you have entered. The default value for any RGB field is 0. Click "Enter" at the bottom of the the window to confirm your new color; the window will now close. The 4 buttons before "Custom Color" are your color history, and you can click on them to change the color back to a color you set earlier. 

    To the right of the "Custom Color" button, there is a rectangle with 4 buttons within it. These 4 buttons are used to set your drawing mode. Click on one to set the mode. 
        "Freehand" allows you to draw freely and scribble all you'd like. 
        "Rectangle" allows you to create rectangles and fill them by clicking and dragging from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the rectangle. (See the next paragraph to change the fill/outline mode)
        "Oval" allows you to do the same as "Rectangle", just with ovals instead.

    "∙∙∙" allows you to access more settings for the drawing mode. Click on it to open the "Pen Options" window. Select the drawing mode from the dropdown menu. "Freehand" is the same as described previously. "Shape" will allow you to set it to "Rectangle" or "Oval", as described previously. 

    In the menu that appears after selecting "Freehand" in said dropdown menu: 
        "Rotational Symmetry" allows you to set how you would like your stroke to be drawn with a symmetry tool. Selecting a 1 in the dropdown menu acts like normal, 2 creates another stroke on the opposite side of the canvas from yours and mimics its path, and 4 is the same as 2, jut with 4 different lines. 
        "Stamping" allows you to turn on the option to stamp with Squares or Circles while drawing freehanded. 
        "Stamp Size" allows you to input what size you'd like the aforementioned stamps to be (the size refers to the width or radius). Click "Enter" to confirm your size change. 
    All changes will be applied automatically after you change them, save the "Stamp Size" option. 

    In the menu that appears after selecting "Shape" in said dropdown menu:
        The first dropdown menu allows you to pick the shape that you wish to create. 
        Clicking on "Fill" will change the fill mode to fill any shape you use the tool to create.
        Clicking on "Outline" will change the mode so any shape you use the tool to create will only have it's outline, no fill. 
    As in the "Freehand" section, all changes are applied automatically. 

    Back to the main window, the last button in the top toolbar, "Clear", will clear the canvas back to white. Resizing the window will also clear the canvas. 

    If you're wondering about the project title, "Organic, homemade, MS paint" originated as a joke a friend and I had when I first shared my ideas for this project. It doesn't really need much explaination, does it? This project is basically just MS paint, which is already a meme-worthy art program, but worse in so many ways, it's probably worth yeeting out a window/defenestrating, but I made it :D (This is so cliché) Personally, it's far superior to actial MS paint because I spent 3 weeks coding this from scratch without any help except for Google; I'm pretty proud of this, it being my first proper programming project ever.
